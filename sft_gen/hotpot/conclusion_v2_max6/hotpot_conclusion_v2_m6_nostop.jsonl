{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n7. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n8. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, conduct your reasoning and determine the next action based on the current context.\n   - Use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required.\n   - Finally, immediately before the closing `</think>`, use <obs></obs> to enclose as few relevant HTML elements as possible (maximum 6).\n     * These elements serve as a context summary and must not influence the action decision you have already made.\n     * Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n9. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first. Now analyzing the key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n7. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n8. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, conduct your reasoning and determine the next action based on the current context.\n   - Use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required.\n   - Finally, immediately before the closing `</think>`, use <obs></obs> to enclose as few relevant HTML elements as possible (maximum 6).\n     * These elements serve as a context summary and must not influence the action decision you have already made.\n     * Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n9. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first. Now analyzing the key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   <obs>\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n\n\nObjective: Which north-western suburb of Adelaide lies within a territory which was established on 26 March 1996?\nObservation: [13087] RootWebArea 'Search: City of Port Adelaide Enfield' focused: True\n\t[13255] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[13257] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[14108] button '🏠'\n\t[13258] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[14110] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[13259] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[14112] button '🎲'\n\t[13100] StaticText 'Results 1-25 of 700 for \"City of Port Adelaide Enfield\"'\n\t[13146] link 'City of Port Adelaide Enfield'\n\t[13261] StaticText '...(s) Port Adelaide, Lee, Cheltenham, Croydon, Playford, Enfield, Torrens, Florey, Dunstan Federal division(s) Port Adelaide, Adelaide, Makin, Sturt Website City of Port Adelaide Enfield LGAs around City of Port Adelaide Enfield: Salisbury Tea Tree Gully City of Port Adelaide Enfield Campbelltown Charles Sturt, Prospect, Walkerville Norwood Payneham & St Peters The City of Port Adelaide Enfield (PAE),[4] located across inner north and north-western suburbs of Adelaide, is one of the largest......'\n\t[13313] StaticText 'from Wikipedia'\n\t[13314] StaticText '1,296 words'\n\t[13150] link 'Parks and gardens of Adelaide'\n\t[13316] StaticText '...of Playford, the City of Salisbury, the City of Tea Tree Gully and the east half of the City of Port Adelaide Enfield.[1] Playford Dauntsey Reserve BMX Skate - Woodford Road, Elizabeth Fremont Park - Yorktown Road, Elizabeth Kalara Reserve - Bulkington Road, Davoren Park Ramsay Park - Womma Road, Edinburgh North Smithfield Civic Park - Anderson Walk, Smithfield Stebonheath Park - Davoren Road, Andrews Farm Womma Park - Womma Road, Edinburgh North Port Adelaide Enfield (part) Jack Watkins Reserve......'\n\t[13344] StaticText 'from Wikipedia'\n\t[13345] StaticText '2,999 words'\n\t[13154] link 'List of Adelaide suburbs'\n\t[13347] StaticText '...of Burnside 8 607 2,375 Linden Park 5065 City of Burnside 1867 4.8 153 1,910 Magill 5072 City of Burnside 1838 7.15 188 8,229 Mount Osmond 5064 City of Burnside 1900 6.75 607 2,375 Rose Park 5067 City of Burnside 1878 2.5 112 1,293 Rosslyn Park 5072 City of Burnside 1844 7 188 1,460 Skye 5072 City of Burnside 8.5 312 278 St Georges 5064 City of Burnside 5.2 153 1,253 Stonyfell 5066 City of Burnside 1926 7 300 1,326 Toorak Gardens 5065 City of Burnside 1917 3.35 111 2,521 Tusmore 5065 City of......'\n\t[13381] StaticText 'from Wikipedia'\n\t[13382] StaticText '3,872 words'\n\t[13158] link 'Enfield, South Australia'\n\t[13385] StaticText 'Enfield, South Australia Enfield Adelaide,\\xa0South Australia Population 6,204 (SAL 2021)[1] Postcode(s) 5085 Location 8\\xa0km (5\\xa0mi) from Adelaide LGA(s) City of Port Adelaide Enfield State electorate(s) Enfield Federal division(s) Adelaide Suburbs around Enfield: Gepps Cross Blair Athol Enfield Clearview Prospect Sefton Park Manningham Enfield is a suburb in Adelaide, Australia.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n7. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n8. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, conduct your reasoning and determine the next action based on the current context.\n   - Use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required.\n   - Finally, immediately before the closing `</think>`, use <obs></obs> to enclose as few relevant HTML elements as possible (maximum 6).\n     * These elements serve as a context summary and must not influence the action decision you have already made.\n     * Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n9.
