{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Who was the widow affected by the Same-sex marriage decision ruled on by the Sixth Circuit from Ohio?\nObservation: [1117] RootWebArea 'Obergefell v.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Who was the widow affected by the Same-sex marriage decision ruled on by the Sixth Circuit from Ohio?\nObservation: [15243] RootWebArea 'Jim Obergefell' focused: True\n\t[15332] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[15334] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[15343] button '🏠'\n\t[15335] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[15345] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[15336] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[15347] button '🎲'\n\t[15249] main ''\n\t\t[15327] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[15337] heading 'Jim Obergefell'\n\t\t[15250] generic 'Jim Obergefell'\n\t\t\t[15351] table ''\n\t\t\t\t[15585] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15592] columnheader 'Jim Obergefell' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[15586] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15593] gridcell 'Obergefell outside the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2015' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16215] link 'U.S. Supreme Court'\n\t\t\t\t[15587] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15594] rowheader 'Born' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[15595] gridcell 'July 7, 1966 Sandusky, Ohio, U.S.' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16223] link 'Sandusky, Ohio'\n\t\t\t\t[15588] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15596] rowheader 'Education' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[15597] gridcell 'University of Cincinnati (BA) Bowling Green State University' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16227] link 'University of Cincinnati'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16229] link 'BA'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16232] link 'Bowling Green State University'\n\t\t\t\t[15589] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15598] rowheader 'Known\\xa0for' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[15599] gridcell 'Plaintiff in Supreme Court case Obergefell v.

You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Who was the widow affected by the Same-sex marriage decision ruled on by the Sixth Circuit from Ohio?\nObservation: [15243] RootWebArea 'Jim Obergefell' focused: True\n\t[15332] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[15334] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[15343] button '🏠'\n\t[15335] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[15345] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[15336] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[15347] button '🎲'\n\t[15249] main ''\n\t\t[15327] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[15337] heading 'Jim Obergefell'\n\t\t[15250] generic 'Jim Obergefell'\n\t\t\t[15351] table ''\n\t\t\t\t[15585] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15592] columnheader 'Jim Obergefell' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[15586] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15593] gridcell 'Obergefell outside the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2015' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16215] link 'U.S. Supreme Court'\n\t\t\t\t[15587] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15594] rowheader 'Born' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[15595] gridcell 'July 7, 1966 Sandusky, Ohio, U.S.' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16223] link 'Sandusky, Ohio'\n\t\t\t\t[15588] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15596] rowheader 'Education' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[15597] gridcell 'University of Cincinnati (BA) Bowling Green State University' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16227] link 'University of Cincinnati'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16229] link 'BA'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[16232] link 'Bowling Green State University'\n\t\t\t\t[15589] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[15598] rowheader 'Known\\xa0for' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[15599] gridcell 'Plaintiff in Supreme Court case Obergefell v.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: What continent were both The Ring and Shonen Jump published in?\nObservation: [1594] RootWebArea 'Search: Shonen Jump' focused: True\n\t[1762] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[1764] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[2353] button '🏠'\n\t[1765] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[2355] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[1766] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[2357] button '🎲'\n\t[1607] StaticText 'Results 1-25 of 3,000 for \"Shonen Jump\"'\n\t[1653] link 'Weekly Shonen Jump (American magazine)'\n\t[1805] StaticText 'from Wikipedia'\n\t[1806] StaticText '3,905 words'\n\t[1657] link 'Shonen Jump (magazine)'\n\t[1809] StaticText 'Shonen Jump (magazine) This article is about the North American magazine.

You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Burt Styler wrote scripts for the CBS television show that was eventually followed by what sequel?\nObservation: [1051] RootWebArea 'Burt Styler' focused: True\n\t[1085] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[1087] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[1096] button '🏠'\n\t[1088] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[1098] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[1089] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[1100] button '🎲'\n\t[1057] main ''\n\t\t[1080] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[1090] heading 'Burt Styler'\n\t\t[1058] generic 'Burt Styler'\n\t\t\t[1104] table ''\n\t\t\t\t[1178] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[1183] columnheader 'Burt Styler' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[1179] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[1184] rowheader 'Born' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[1185] gridcell 'February 20, 1925 New York City, New York, U.S.' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1233] link 'New York City'\n\t\t\t\t[1180] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[1186] rowheader 'Died' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[1187] gridcell 'June 13, 2011 (aged\\xa086) Tarzana, California, U.S.' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1242] link 'Tarzana, California'\n\t\t\t\t[1181] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[1188] rowheader 'Occupation' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[1189] gridcell 'TV/Film screenwriter/producer' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[1182] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[1190] rowheader 'Years\\xa0active' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[1191] gridcell '1949–1989' required: False\n\t\t\t[1116] StaticText 'Burt Malcolm Styler (February 20, 1925 – June 13, 2011) was an American television and film screenwriter and producer.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: When was the national park next to Ghost Town Village chartered by Congress?\nObservation: [3140] RootWebArea 'Great Smoky Mountains National Park' focused: True\n\t[3660] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[3662] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[3671] button '🏠'\n\t[3663] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[3673] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[3664] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[3675] button '🎲'\n\t[3146] main ''\n\t\t[3655] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[3665] heading 'Great Smoky Mountains National Park'\n\t\t[3147] generic 'Great Smoky Mountains National Park'\n\t\t\t[3679] table ''\n\t\t\t\t[5445] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5463] columnheader 'Great Smoky Mountains National Park' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[5446] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5464] gridcell 'IUCN category II (national park)[1]' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9015] link 'IUCN category'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9017] link 'national park'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9019] superscript ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[9022] link '[1]'\n\t\t\t\t[5447] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5465] gridcell 'View from the Cliff Tops formation atop Mount Le\\xa0Conte' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9031] link 'Mount Le\\xa0Conte'\n\t\t\t\t[5448] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5466] gridcell 'Great Smoky Mountains National Park Location on the Tennessee and North Carolina border Great Smoky Mountains National Park Location in the United States' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[5449] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5467] rowheader 'Location' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[5468] gridcell 'Swain & Haywood counties in North Carolina; Sevier, Blount, & Cocke counties in Tennessee, United States' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9059] link 'Swain'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9061] link 'Haywood'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9063] link 'North Carolina'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9065] link 'Sevier'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9067] link 'Blount'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9069] link 'Cocke'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9070] StaticText ' counties in '\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9071] link 'Tennessee'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9072] StaticText ', United States'\n\t\t\t\t[5450] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5469] rowheader 'Nearest\\xa0city' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[5470] gridcell 'Cherokee, North Carolina, Bryson City, North Carolina, Townsend, Tennessee, Cosby, Tennessee and Gatlinburg, Tennessee' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9081] link 'Cherokee, North Carolina'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9083] link 'Bryson City, North Carolina'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9085] link 'Townsend, Tennessee'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9087] link 'Cosby, Tennessee'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9088] StaticText ' and '\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9089] link 'Gatlinburg, Tennessee'\n\t\t\t\t[5451] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5471] rowheader 'Coordinates' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[5472] gridcell '35°36′40″N 83°25′30″W[2]' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9098] link '35°36′40″N 83°25′30″W'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[9101] generic 'Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9099] superscript ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[9109] link '[2]'\n\t\t\t\t[5452] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5473] rowheader 'Area' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[5474] gridcell '522,419 acres (2,114.15\\xa0km2)[3]' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9117] superscript ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9119] superscript ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[9121] link '[3]'\n\t\t\t\t[5453] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5475] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[5476] gridcell 'June 15, 1934' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[5454] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5477] rowheader 'Visitors' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[5478] gridcell '12,191,834 (in\\xa02024)[4]' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9131] superscript ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[9132] link '[4]'\n\t\t\t\t[5455] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5479] rowheader 'Governing\\xa0body' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[5480] gridcell 'National Park Service' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9139] link 'National Park Service'\n\t\t\t\t[5456] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5481] rowheader 'Website' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[5482] gridcell 'nps .gov /grsm' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9143] link 'nps .gov /grsm'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[9144] StaticText 'nps.gov/grsm'\n\t\t\t\t[5457] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5483] columnheader '' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[5458] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5484] columnheader 'UNESCO World Heritage Site' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[9150] link 'UNESCO World Heritage Site'\n\t\t\t[3816] StaticText 'Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a '\n\t\t\t[3818] link 'national park of the United States'\n\t\t\t[3819] StaticText ' in the '\n\t\t\t[3820] link 'southeast'\n\t\t\t[3821] StaticText ', with parts in '\n\t\t\t[3822] link 'North Carolina'\n\t\t\t[3823] StaticText ' and '\n\t\t\t[3824] link 'Tennessee'\n\t\t\t[3825] StaticText '.

It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Led Zeppelin Deluxe Edition was a set of albums released by the group who formed on what date?\nObservation: [9506] RootWebArea 'Led Zeppelin' focused: True\n\t[10324] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[10326] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[10335] button '🏠'\n\t[10327] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[10337] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[10328] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[10339] button '🎲'\n\t[9512] main ''\n\t\t[10319] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[10329] heading 'Led Zeppelin'\n\t\t[9513] generic 'Led Zeppelin'\n\t\t\t[10342] note ''\n\t\t\t\t[10454] StaticText 'This article is about the band.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6.

Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Similac is marketed by a health care company that has how many employees ?\nObservation: [518] RootWebArea 'Search: Similac' focused: True\n\t[643] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[645] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[809] button '🏠'\n\t[646] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[811] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[647] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[813] button '🎲'\n\t[531] StaticText 'Results 1-19 of 19 for \"Similac\"'\n\t[564] link 'Similac'\n\t[650] StaticText 'Similac Similac Similac infant formula in a supermarket aisle Product type Infant formula Organic infant formula Soy-based infant formula Prenatal vitamins Breastfeeding supplements Owner Abbott Laboratories Country United States Introduced 1925\\xa0(1925) Related brands Pure Bliss Go & Grow Markets Worldwide Previous owners Moores & Ross Milk Company Tagline Because of Science Website similac.com pureblissbaby.com Similac (for \"similar to lactation\") is a brand of infant formula that was developed......'\n\t[664] StaticText 'from Wikipedia'\n\t[665] StaticText '1,539 words'\n\t[568] link 'Abbott Laboratories'\n\t[667] StaticText '...Similac, BinaxNOW, Ensure, Glucerna, ZonePerfect, FreeStyle Libre, i-STAT and MitraClip.

It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences.

Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8.

Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Chris Bacon composed the film score for which 2011 film based loosely one of William Shakespeare's plays?\nObservation: [1] RootWebArea 'User:The other Kiwix guy/Landing' focused: True\n\t[25] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[27] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[43] button '🏠'\n\t[28] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[45] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[29] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[47] button '🎲'\n\t[18] main ''\n\t\t[19] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[30] heading 'User:The other Kiwix guy/Landing'\n\t\t[21] generic 'User:The other Kiwix guy/Landing'\n\t\t\t[39] StaticText '< User:The other Kiwix guy'\n\t\t\t[76] StaticText 'Welcome to '\n\t\t\t[77] link 'Wikipedia'\n\t\t\t[78] StaticText 'The free encyclopedia.'\n\t\t\t[80] StaticText '7,037,579 articles in '\n\t\t\t[83] link 'English'\n\t\t\t[84] heading 'Arts'\n\t\t\t[85] link 'Architecture'\n\t\t\t[87] link 'Books'\n\t\t\t[89] link 'Cinematography'\n\t\t\t[91] link 'Dance'\n\t\t\t[93] link 'Design'\n\t\t\t[95] link 'Fashion'\n\t\t\t[97] link 'Films'\n\t\t\t[99] link 'Gastronomy'\n\t\t\t[101] link 'Literature'\n\t\t\t[103] link 'Magic (illusion)'\n\t\t\t[105] link 'Music'\n\t\t\t[107] link 'Painting'\n\t\t\t[109] link 'Photography'\n\t\t\t[111] link 'Poetry'\n\t\t\t[113] link 'Sculpture'\n\t\t\t[115] link 'Theatre'\n\t\t\t[117] heading 'Geography'\n\t\t\t[118] link 'Africa'\n\t\t\t[120] link 'Antarctica'\n\t\t\t[122] link 'Arctic'\n\t\t\t[124] link 'Asia'\n\t\t\t[126] link 'Caribbean'\n\t\t\t[128] link 'Central America'\n\t\t\t[130] link 'Europe'\n\t\t\t[132] link 'Latin America'\n\t\t\t[134] link 'Mediterranean'\n\t\t\t[136] link 'Middle East'\n\t\t\t[138] link 'North America'\n\t\t\t[140] link 'Oceania'\n\t\t\t[142] link 'South America'\n\t\t\t[144] link 'Cartography'\n\t\t\t[145] heading 'History'\n\t\t\t[146] link 'Ancient Egypt'\n\t\t\t[148] link 'Ancient Greece'\n\t\t\t[150] link 'Ancient Near East'\n\t\t\t[152] link 'Ancient Rome'\n\t\t\t[154] link 'Archaeology'\n\t\t\t[156] link 'British Empire'\n\t\t\t[158] link 'Byzantine Empire'\n\t\t\t[160] link 'Colonialism'\n\t\t\t[162] link 'Crusades'\n\t\t\t[164] link 'Heraldry'\n\t\t\t[166] link 'History of science'\n\t\t\t[168] link 'Imperial China'\n\t\t\t[170] link 'Indian independence movement'\n\t\t\t[172] link 'Japan'\n\t\t\t[174] link 'Middle Ages'\n\t\t\t[176] link 'Mughal Empire'\n\t\t\t[178] link 'Ottoman Empire'\n\t\t\t[180] link 'Russian Empire'\n\t\t\t[182] link 'Sasanian Empire'\n\t\t\t[184] link 'Seljuk Empire'\n\t\t\t[186] link 'Soviet Union'\n\t\t\t[188] link 'War'\n\t\t\t[189] heading 'Sciences'\nHISTORY_ACTION: \n\nHISTORY_info: \n\n", "output_seq": "<think>\nTo answer the objective, I need to find which 2011 film score Chris Bacon composed that is based loosely on a Shakespeare play.

All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: The top grossing film in Australia in 2000 featured this Australian actress who is also known for the role of Doreen Burns in the

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: The top grossing film in Australia in 2000 featured this Australian actress who is also known for the role of Doreen Burns in the

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences.

By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: The Quivering is a video game in a subgenre where the games tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or what?\nObservation: [1] RootWebArea 'User:The other Kiwix guy/Landing' focused: True\n\t[25] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[27] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[43] button '🏠'\n\t[28] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[45] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[29] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[47] button '🎲'\n\t[18] main ''\n\t\t[19] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[30] heading 'User:The other Kiwix guy/Landing'\n\t\t[21] generic 'User:The other Kiwix guy/Landing'\n\t\t\t[39] StaticText '< User:The other Kiwix guy'\n\t\t\t[76] StaticText 'Welcome to '\n\t\t\t[77] link 'Wikipedia'\n\t\t\t[78] StaticText 'The free encyclopedia.'\n\t\t\t[80] StaticText '7,037,579 articles in '\n\t\t\t[83] link 'English'\n\t\t\t[84] heading 'Arts'\n\t\t\t[85] link 'Architecture'\n\t\t\t[87] link 'Books'\n\t\t\t[89] link 'Cinematography'\n\t\t\t[91] link 'Dance'\n\t\t\t[93] link 'Design'\n\t\t\t[95] link 'Fashion'\n\t\t\t[97] link 'Films'\n\t\t\t[99] link 'Gastronomy'\n\t\t\t[101] link 'Literature'\n\t\t\t[103] link 'Magic (illusion)'\n\t\t\t[105] link 'Music'\n\t\t\t[107] link 'Painting'\n\t\t\t[109] link 'Photography'\n\t\t\t[111] link 'Poetry'\n\t\t\t[113] link 'Sculpture'\n\t\t\t[115] link 'Theatre'\n\t\t\t[117] heading 'Geography'\n\t\t\t[118] link 'Africa'\n\t\t\t[120] link 'Antarctica'\n\t\t\t[122] link 'Arctic'\n\t\t\t[124] link 'Asia'\n\t\t\t[126] link 'Caribbean'\n\t\t\t[128] link 'Central America'\n\t\t\t[130] link 'Europe'\n\t\t\t[132] link 'Latin America'\n\t\t\t[134] link 'Mediterranean'\n\t\t\t[136] link 'Middle East'\n\t\t\t[138] link 'North America'\n\t\t\t[140] link 'Oceania'\n\t\t\t[142] link 'South America'\n\t\t\t[144] link 'Cartography'\n\t\t\t[145] heading 'History'\n\t\t\t[146] link 'Ancient Egypt'\n\t\t\t[148] link 'Ancient Greece'\n\t\t\t[150] link 'Ancient Near East'\n\t\t\t[152] link 'Ancient Rome'\n\t\t\t[154] link 'Archaeology'\n\t\t\t[156] link 'British Empire'\n\t\t\t[158] link 'Byzantine Empire'\n\t\t\t[160] link 'Colonialism'\n\t\t\t[162] link 'Crusades'\n\t\t\t[164] link 'Heraldry'\n\t\t\t[166] link 'History of science'\n\t\t\t[168] link 'Imperial China'\n\t\t\t[170] link 'Indian independence movement'\n\t\t\t[172] link 'Japan'\n\t\t\t[174] link 'Middle Ages'\n\t\t\t[176] link 'Mughal Empire'\n\t\t\t[178] link 'Ottoman Empire'\n\t\t\t[180] link 'Russian Empire'\n\t\t\t[182] link 'Sasanian Empire'\n\t\t\t[184] link 'Seljuk Empire'\n\t\t\t[186] link 'Soviet Union'\n\t\t\t[188] link 'War'\n\t\t\t[189] heading 'Sciences'\nHISTORY_ACTION: \n\nHISTORY_info: \n\n", "output_seq": "<think>\n<obs>\n[25] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n[97] link 'Films'\n[77] link 'Wikipedia'\n[30] heading 'User:The other Kiwix guy/Landing'\n[84] heading 'Arts'\n[145] heading 'History'\n[189] heading 'Sciences'\n[21] generic 'User:The other Kiwix guy/Landing'\n[18] main ''\n[28] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n</obs>\nThe user's objective is to find out the other way (besides horror graphics) that games in the subgenre of \"The Quivering\" try to frighten players.

Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9.

These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required.

All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences.

Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Which north-western suburb of Adelaide lies within a territory which was established on 26 March 1996?\nObservation: [916]

It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Which north-western suburb of Adelaide lies within a territory which was established on 26 March 1996?\nObservation: [916]

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Which of the two colleges are private, Bilkent University or Boise State University?\nObservation: [518] RootWebArea 'Search: Bilkent University' focused: True\n\t[686] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[688] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[1033] button '🏠'\n\t[689] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[1035] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[690] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[1037] button '🎲'\n\t[531] StaticText 'Results 1-25 of 830 for \"Bilkent University\"'\n\t[577] link 'Bilkent University'\n\t[692] StaticText '...Nickname Bilkent Judges (American Football) Mascot Bilkent Fox Website w3.bilkent.edu.tr Bilkent University (Turkish: Bilkent Üniversitesi) is a private non-profit research university located in Ankara, Turkey.

By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7.
