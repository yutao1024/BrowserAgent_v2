You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: What animated series is Pent-House Mouse related to?\nObservation: [799] RootWebArea 'Pent-House Mouse' focused: True\n\t[856] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[858] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[867] button '🏠'\n\t[859] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[869] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[860] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[871] button '🎲'\n\t[805] main ''\n\t\t[851] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[861] heading 'Pent-House Mouse'\n\t\t[806] generic 'Pent-House Mouse'\n\t\t\t[875] table ''\n\t\t\t\t[938] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[952] columnheader 'Pent-House Mouse' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[939] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[953] gridcell '' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[940] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[954] rowheader 'Directed by' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[955] gridcell 'Chuck Jones Maurice Noble' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1043] link 'Chuck Jones'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1045] link 'Maurice Noble'\n\t\t\t\t[941] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[956] rowheader 'Story by' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[957] gridcell 'Chuck Jones Michael Maltese' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1049] link 'Chuck Jones'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1051] link 'Michael Maltese'\n\t\t\t\t[942] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[958] rowheader 'Produced by' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[959] gridcell 'Chuck Jones Les Goldman Walter Bien' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1055] link 'Chuck Jones'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1057] StaticText 'Les GoldmanWalter Bien'\n\t\t\t\t[943] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[960] rowheader 'Starring' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[961] gridcell 'Mel Blanc' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1062] link 'Mel Blanc'\n\t\t\t\t[944] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[962] rowheader 'Music by' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[963] gridcell 'Eugene Poddany' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[945] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[964] rowheader 'Animation by' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[965] gridcell 'Ken Harris Tom Ray Dick Thompson Ben Washam' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1067] link 'Ken Harris'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1069] link 'Tom Ray'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1071] link 'Dick Thompson'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1073] link 'Ben Washam'\n\t\t\t\t[946] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[966] rowheader 'Color process' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[967] gridcell 'Metrocolor' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1079] link 'Metrocolor'\n\t\t\t\t[947] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[968] rowheader 'Production company' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1082] StaticText 'Productioncompany'\n\t\t\t\t\t[969] gridcell 'Sib Tower 12 Productions' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1086] link 'Sib Tower 12 Productions'\n\t\t\t\t[948] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[970] rowheader 'Distributed by' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[971] gridcell 'Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1089] link 'Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer'\n\t\t\t\t[949] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[972] rowheader 'Release date' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[973] gridcell 'July\\xa027,\\xa01963' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[950] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[974] rowheader 'Running time' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[975] gridcell '7:12' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[951] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[976] rowheader 'Language' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[977] gridcell 'English' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[1102] link 'English'\n\t\t\t[891] StaticText 'Pent-House Mouse is the first '\n\t\t\t[894] link 'Tom and Jerry'\n\t\t\t[895] StaticText ' short produced and directed by '\n\t\t\t[896] link 'Chuck Jones'\n\t\t\t[897] StaticText ' after being fired from '\n\t\t\t[898] link 'Warner Bros.

You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: What company later acquired one of the magazines Tully Jensen was featured in?\nObservation: [518] RootWebArea 'Search: Tully Jensen' focused: True\n\t[686] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[688] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[943] button '🏠'\n\t[689] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[945] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[690] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[947] button '🎲'\n\t[531] StaticText 'Results 1-25 of 500 for \"Tully Jensen\"'\n\t[577] link 'Tully Jensen'\n\t[692] StaticText '...Jensen Tully Jensen Born Alicia Tully Jensen (1963-12-02) December 2, 1963 United States Other\\xa0names Tully Occupation(s) Model, actress Spouse Antonio Sabàto Jr. \\u200b \\u200b (m.\\xa01992; div.\\xa01993)\\u200b Modeling information Height 5\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in (1.70\\xa0m) Hair color Brown Eye color Brown Alicia Tully Jensen (born December 2, 1963) is a model and an actress.

By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Similac is marketed by a health care company that has how many employees ?\nObservation: [815] RootWebArea 'Abbott Laboratories' focused: True\n\t[1244] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[1246] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[1255] button '🏠'\n\t[1247] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[1257] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[1248] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[1259] button '🎲'\n\t[821] main ''\n\t\t[1239] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[1249] heading 'Abbott Laboratories'\n\t\t[822] generic 'Abbott Laboratories'\n\t\t\t[1262] note ''\n\t\t\t\t[1376] StaticText '\"Abbott (company)\" redirects here.

You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Which American music group played in the film \"Hysterical\"?\nObservation: [518] RootWebArea 'Search: Hysterical film' focused: True\n\t[686] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[688] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[964] button '🏠'\n\t[689] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[966] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[690] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[968] button '🎲'\n\t[531] StaticText 'Results 1-25 of 5,000 for \"Hysterical film\"'\n\t[577] link 'Hysterical Blindness (film)'\n\t[692] StaticText '...film directed by Mira Nair and written by Laura Cahill, based on her stage play of the same name.

You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: The Quivering is a video game in a subgenre where the games tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or what?\nObservation: [878] RootWebArea 'Search: horror video game subgenre' focused: True\n\t[1046] textbox \"Search 'Wikipedia'\" required: False\n\t[1048] link 'Go to welcome page'\n\t\t[1666] button '🏠'\n\t[1049] link \"Go to the main page of 'Wikipedia'\"\n\t\t[1668] button 'Wikipedia'\n\t[1050] link 'Go to a randomly selected page'\n\t\t[1670] button '🎲'\n\t[891] StaticText 'Results 1-25 of 2,000 for \"horror video game subgenre\"'\n\t[937] link 'Horror'\n\t[1052] StaticText '...horror film, a subgenre of horror film Psychological horror film, a subgenre of horror film Postmodern horror, a subgenre of horror film Indonesian horror, Indonesian horror film Thai horror, Thai horror film Horror comics, comic books focusing on horror Horror punk, a music genre Horrorcore, a subgenre of hip hop music based on horror Horrorgame, a video game genre Survival horror, a video game subgenre of horror and action-adventure Horror podcast, a podcast genre Films Horror (2002 film), an......'\n\t[1125] StaticText 'from Wikipedia'\n\t[1126] StaticText '370 words'\n\t[941] link 'Action-adventure game'\n\t[1128] StaticText '...video games List of platform games An action-adventure game is a video game hybrid genre that combines core elements from both the action game and adventure game genres.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Which north-western suburb of Adelaide lies within a territory which was established on 26 March 1996?\nObservation: [916]

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"\"N/A\"\" in the bracket.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5. All reasoning must be inside `<think></think>` tags, and there must be no output before `<think></think>`.\n6. After `<think></think>`, only the action should be generated in the correct format, enclosed in code fences. For example:\n   <think>\n   Based on the objective and previous actions, I need to identify the most relevant HTML elements first.\n   <obs>\n   [5177] rowheader 'Established' required: False\n   [5178] gridcell 'September 15, 1764' required: False\n   [5200] button 'Search'\n   [2933] link 'History'\n   </obs>\n   Now analyzing these key elements, the element [5178] contains the date information I'm looking for.\n   <conclusion>The university was established on September 15, 1764.</conclusion>\n   I should click on this element to verify or proceed.\n   </think>\n   ```click [5178] [September 15, 1764]```\n7. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.\n8. Always format actions correctly: \n```command [parameters]```\nFor example, if searching for \"\"death row inmates in the US\"\" in a search field with ID `21`, correctly format it as:\n```type [21] [death row inmates in the US] [1]```\nAvoid incorrect formats that omit brackets around parameters or numeric values.\n9. Between <think></think>, you need to:\n   - First, use <obs></obs> to enclose the 5-10 most relevant HTML elements from the current observation that are most likely to help achieve the objective. These elements should be selected based on:\n     * Answer-containing elements with relevant information\n     * Semantic relevance to the objective\n     * Interactive elements (links, buttons, input fields)\n     * Elements that complement or verify previous findings (HISTORY_info)\n     * Avoid elements already interacted with (check HISTORY_ACTION)\n   - Then, use <conclusion></conclusion> to enclose the information obtained in this round that is relevant to the current query. Note that if there is no valid information, this part is not required. The enclosed information must be directly usable to answer the original query.\n   - Format each element in <obs> exactly as: [id] element_type 'content' [attributes]\n   - Extract 5-10 most relevant elements only, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\n\n\nObjective: Which north-western suburb of Adelaide lies within a territory which was established on 26 March 1996?\nObservation: [2031]
