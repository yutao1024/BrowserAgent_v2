From the accessibility tree, I see that \"Frankie Campbell (born Francisco Camilli), American boxer\" is listed, suggesting he is Dolph Camilli's brother and a professional boxer. To confirm this and find the number of his professional wins, I should click the link related to \"Frankie Campbell\" if available. However, I do not see a direct link for Frankie Campbell, but there is a link for \"Doug Camilli\" (likely another relative) and \"Camilli\" (possibly a surname page). Since \"Frankie Campbell\" is the only boxer listed and likely the brother in question, I should look for more information about his boxing record. The best next step is to click the \"Camilli\" link to see if it provides more details about the family and Frankie Campbell's boxing record.\n</think>\n```click [584] [Camilli]```"}

It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You should refer to historical actions when issue an action and try not to make repetitive actions\n5.

{"input_seq": "You are a browser interaction assistant designed to execute step-by-step browser operations efficiently and precisely to complete the user's task. You are provided with specific tasks and webpage-related information, and you need to output accurate actions to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: There are the actions you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nInformation already found: Information related to the current query that has been identified in historical actions. You need to integrate and supplement this information.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id] [content]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"\"Enter\"\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id] [content]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.
